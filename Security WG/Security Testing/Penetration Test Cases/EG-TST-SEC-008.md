| **Test case name**      | **Session Prediction Vulnerability**                         |
| Test purpose            | Through the session prediction vulnerability test, to judged that the randomness of the session ID generated by the server is strong enough (there is no predictable law), to ensure that there is no session prediction vulnerability in the web application. |
| Test description        | The attacker analyzes the structure or law of the sessionID by collecting some valid sessionIDs, and then cooperates with some brute force cracking methods until they successfully access the web application as a user. |
| Test tool               | BurpSuite (hereinafter referred to as "Burp")<br/>Note: It is recommended to use Burp's built-in browser to cooperate with the  browser used by Burp (the capture result is more stable),  the  opening method is: Proxy -> Intercept -> Open Broswer |
| Test tool configuration | Test tool and environment setup description                  |
| config step 1           | Download and install Burp: <br/>Visit [https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload to](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=zh-CN&prev=_t&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) and download the Burp community version, and click Install. |
| config step 2           | Import the Burp certificate into the browser: (If you use Burp's built-in browser, you can skip this step) <br/>①Open Burp, use the browser to visit 127.0.0.1:8080, click "CA Certificate"  in the upper right corner of the page, and download the "cacert.der"  certificate file ; <br/>②Enter browser settings -> privacy/security -> certificate -> view certificate, open the certificate manager page, click "Import", and  import the "cacert.der" certificate file. (Please check "Trust this certification authority to identify the website" when importing) |
| config step 3           | Set proxy: (If you use Burp's built-in browser, you can skip this step) <br/>①Set Burp port to 8080 (default); <br/>②Set browser proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080 <br/>Note: Burp can be used when it is not in use or after use Turn off the browser proxy. |
| Test Mode               | Manual                                                       |
| **Test steps**          | **Test step description and expected result**                |
| Test step 1             | ①Start Burp, log in to the account through the browser, use Burp to capture the log in request package(Note: the response of the request should have a "Set-Cookie" response header), and then send the captured login package to Burp "Sequenser" module;<br/> |
| Test step 2             | ②In the "Select Live Capture Request" block, this should list the request that just captured; then click the "Start live capture" button, start to get sessionIDs automatically;<br/>(Note: This test requires a relatively large number of sessionIDs (such as 1000 or more) for the analysis results could be more convincing.) |
| Test step 3             | ③After obtaining a sufficient number of sessionIDs, click the "Pause" or "Stop" button to stop the acquisition, and then click the "Analyze now" button to start the analysis;<br/>Wait a moment, the "Sequencer" module will generate analysis results;<br/> |
| **Expected result**     | In test step 3: The analysis result generated by the "Sequencer" module shows "The overall quality of randomness within the sample is estimated to be: execellent."<br/> |
