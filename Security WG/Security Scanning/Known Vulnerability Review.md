This template is intended to be used to document the outcome of the impact analysis related to the known vulnerability reported by EdgeGallery security tools. Security tools can identify the known vulnerabilities contained in the third party components embedded within EdgeGallery deliverables.

Note: PTLs should report in the template below only the vulnerabilities that security tools is reporting as **"High"** and **"Medium"**.

After approval of M0 for an EdgeGallery release, the Security Working Group will create a new section in the security wiki space for the release containing copies of the known vulnerability page for the included projects based on the most recent Security tools scans for the projects. There will be a table for each repository. Please do not combine findings as this makes it difficult to understand the security posture of each EdgeGallery project.

Each project must update its known security/vulnerability table for each milestone, as follows. The final table will be presented to the TSC at Code Freeze milestone (M4).

### M1

*   The PTL will review the security tools scans for their project and create their “known vulnerability page”

    *   **Repository:** The repository containing the vulnerability

    *   **Group, Artifact, Version:** Group, artifact and version of the package

    *   **Problem Code:** The CVE report for each vulnerability is listed

    *   **Effective/Ineffective:** Each vulnerability is identified as being a Effective or Ineffective

        *   Effective - there is an execution path of the EdgeGallery code that will cause the vulnerable code to be executed

        *   Ineffective - there is no execution path of the EdgeGallery code that will cause the vulnerable code to be executed

    *   **Resolvable by Project:** Each vulnerability is identified as something that the project can or cannot fix.

        *   Yes - The project can upgrade, replace or remove the package to eliminate the vulnerable code.

        *   No - Either there is no package upgrade or replacement available that eliminates the vulnerability.

    *   **Impact Analysis:**

        *   Explanation of why the vulnerability is Effective or Ineffective.

        *   Description of whether the package is a Direct or Transitive Dependency:

            *   Direct - developer explicitly included the package and can be directly upgraded by the developer

            *   Transitive - package is included by virtue of being a dependency in another package; the developer may not be able to upgrade.

            *   If the dependency is in a Transitive package, list the Direct Dependency(ies) that causes it to be include in the EdgeGallery code.

    *   **Action:** Each vulnerability has a corresponding Gitee issue ticket with the following information:

        *   Name of the package with the vulnerability.

        *   If the package is a Transitive Dependency, name of the Direct Dependency that results in the inclusion of the vulnerable package.

        *   One of the following paths to resolution:

            *   Vulnerable package (Direct or Transitive) will be replaced or upgraded with available non-vulnerable package.

            *   Vulnerable package replacement or upgrade is not available:

                *   Direct Dependency - Project will monitor for a fix.

                *   Transitive Dependency - Project will work with the owner of the Direct Dependency develop an upgrade path or will investigate a replacement .

        *   If the vulnerability is effective, the Priority must be set to Highest.

        *   If the vulnerability is ineffective, the Priority must be set to High.

*   The Security Working Group will review each Security/Vulnerability in the “known vulnerability page”:

    *   Ensure that each vulnerability found by security tools is listed in the review table.

    *   Ensure that each vulnerability has a Gitee issue ticket.

    *   Ensure that project follows-up all required actions: e.g., execution of package upgrade from previous release Gitee issue ticket. 

### M2 & M3

*   The PTL will review the security tools scans for their project weekly and update their “known vulnerability page”

*   The Security Working Group will not review the tables, trusting that the PTLs are keeping the tables up to date

*   The Security Working Group will answer questions from the PTLs or their delegates

### M4

*   The PTL will finalize their “known vulnerability page” making it consistent with the security tools scans

*   The Security Working Group will review each “known vulnerability page”

    *   Where necessary, the Security Working Group representative will communicate with the PTL to clarify the information in the table

    *   Ensure that project follows-up all required actions: e. g. execution of package upgrade from current release Gitee issue ticket

    *   When each table has been satisfactorily completed, the Security Working Group will create a sanitized copy of each table in the public wiki to be included in the Release Notes

Note: A PTL may delegate the task of analyzing security tools findings and updating the “known vulnerability page” to authorized security subject matter experts on their team. In such a case, if those experts do not have access to the protected wiki space, the PTL should create a Gitee issue ticket in SEC Gitee issue project to request access. Note that only committers can be granted access to the security tools reports.

It is recommended to **first update to the latest version** of the third party components available. In case the latest third party components still reports some vulnerabilities, you must provide an impact analysis as illustrated in the example below.
