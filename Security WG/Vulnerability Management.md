## EdgeGallery Security Issues Management Process

After receiving the security issues, we will handle the issues according to the following process:
- Upon receiving a suspected security issue, the vulnerability management team will immediately confirm the integrity of reported information and severity of the issue. EdgeGallery uses the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) 3.1 specification and calculator to assess the impact of security issues found in EdgeGallery.
- A community team will be organized to carry out technical analysis, confirm the details of the issue, and provide analysis reports.
- Upon confirming the vulnerability and completing the [application for CVE ID](https://cveform.mitre.org/), the vulnerability will be communicated, the subsequent fixing and release plan applied accordingly, and the security advisory (SA) will be prepared.
- The vulnerability patch development/verification will be completed and restricted disclosure initiated.
- The release patches and SA will be made public.
