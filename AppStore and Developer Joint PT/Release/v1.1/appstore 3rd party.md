# Tripartite vulnerability investigation

## 1. AppStore tripartite dependencies check results(Critical:6,High:17)

The confirmed vulnerabilities are as follows（Note: the dependent tripartite is already the latest version。）：

| Module      |  Dependent components  |Version| vulnerability|  vulnerability level            |   vulnerability description |  resolved or not |    Description    |
| ---------| --------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------- |----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
|appstore| log4j  | 1.2.17 | CVE-2019-17571  |  Critical        |	Included in Log4j 1.2 is a SocketServer class that is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted data which can be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary code when combined with a deserialization gadget when listening to untrusted network traffic for log data. This affects Log4j versions up to 1.2 up to 1.2.17. | no        |      |
|appstore| netty-transport  | 4.1.36.Final | CVE-2019-20444  |  Critical        |HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows an HTTP header that lacks a colon, which might be interpreted as a separate header with an incorrect syntax, or might be interpreted as an "invalid fold." | no        | servicecomb 1.3.0 Passively dependent tripartite     |
|appstore| netty-transport  | 4.1.36.Final | CVE-2019-20445  |  Critical        |HttpObjectDecoder.java in Netty before 4.1.44 allows a Content-Length header to be accompanied by a second Content-Length header, or by a Transfer-Encoding header.| no| servicecomb 1.3.0 Passively dependent tripartite     |
|appstore| vertx-core  | 3.9.4 | CVE-2019-17640  |  Critical        |TIn Eclipse Vert.x 3.4.x up to 3.9.4, 4.0.0.milestone1, 4.0.0.milestone2, 4.0.0.milestone3, 4.0.0.milestone4, 4.0.0.milestone5, 4.0.0.Beta1, 4.0.0.Beta2, and 4.0.0.Beta3, StaticHandler doesn't correctly processes back slashes on Windows Operating systems, allowing, escape the webroot folder to the current working directory | no| servicecomb 1.3.0 Passively dependent tripartite     |
|appstore|docker-java-core  | 3.2.7 | CVE-2019-13139 |  High|	In Docker before 18.09.4, an attacker who is capable of supplying or manipulating the build path for the "docker build" command would be able to gain command execution. An issue exists in the way "docker build" processes remote git URLs, and results in command injection into the underlying "git clone" command, leading to code execution in the context of the user executing the "docker build" command. This occurs because git ref can be misinterpreted as a flag. | no| Already the latest version     |
|appstore|docker-java-core  | 3.2.7 | CVE-2019-13509 |  High|	In Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x before 18.03.1-ee-10), Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log. This applies to a scenario where docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that includes (non external) secrets. It potentially applies to other API users of the stack API if they resend the secret. | no| Already the latest version     |
|appstore|docker-java-core  | 3.2.7 | CVE-2019-16884 |  High|	runc through 1.0.0-rc8, as used in Docker through 19.03.2-ce and other products, allows AppArmor restriction bypass because libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go incorrectly checks mount targets, and thus a malicious Docker image can mount over a /proc directory.| no| Already the latest version     |
|appstore|docker-java-core  | 3.2.7 | CVE-2019-5736 |  High|	runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe. | no| Already the latest version     |
|appstore|foundation-ssl  | 1.3.0 | CVE-2004-0009 |  High|	Apache-SSL 1.3.28+1.52 and earlier, with SSLVerifyClient set to 1 or 3 and SSLFakeBasicAuth enabled, allows remote attackers to forge a client certificate by using basic authentication with the "one-line DN" of the target user. | no| servicecomb 1.3.0 Passively dependent tripartite     |
|appstore|mybatis-spring  | 2.0.6 | CVE-2020-26945 |  High|	MyBatis before 3.5.6 mishandles deserialization of object streams. | no| mybatis-spring-boot-starter 2.1.4 Passively dependent tripartite     |
|appstore|mybatis-spring-boot-starter  | 2.1.4 | CVE-2020-26945 |  High|	MyBatis before 3.5.6 mishandles deserialization of object streams. | no| Already the latest version     |
|appstore|netty-transport  | 4.1.36.Final | CVE-2019-16869 |  High|	Netty before 4.1.42.Final mishandles whitespace before the colon in HTTP headers (such as a "Transfer-Encoding : chunked" line), which leads to HTTP request smuggling. | no| servicecomb 1.3.0 Passively dependent tripartite     |
|appstore|netty-transport  | 4.1.36.Final | CVE-2020-11612 |  High|	The ZlibDecoders in Netty 4.1.x before 4.1.46 allow for unbounded memory allocation while decoding a ZlibEncoded byte stream. An attacker could send a large ZlibEncoded byte stream to the Netty server, forcing the server to allocate all of its free memory to a single decoder. | no| servicecomb 1.3.0 Passively dependent tripartite     |
|appstore|spring-jdbc  | 5.1.8.RELEASE | CVE-2020-5398 |  High| 	In Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.3, versions 5.1.x prior to 5.1.13, and versions 5.0.x prior to 5.0.16, an application is vulnerable to a reflected file download (RFD) attack when it sets a "Content-Disposition" header in the response where the filename attribute is derived from user supplied input. | no| servicecomb 1.3.2 Passively dependent tripartite     |
|appstore| spring-security-core  | 5.1.5.RELEASE | CVE-2018-1258 |  High|	Spring Framework version 5.0.5 when used in combination with any versions of Spring Security contains an authorization bypass when using method security. An unauthorized malicious user can gain unauthorized access to methods that should be restricted. | no| Can only update to the highest version of 5.3, update to version 5.4.x, and you will get an error when you perform the test hard.     |
